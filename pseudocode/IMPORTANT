2. graphs are ultimately the representational bottleneck of the protein itself. When we have protein-specific graphs, we are looking at it per data-sample
we are not clustering structures together, but we are looking at nodes within individual structures
Pruning advice:
a few assumptions: distinction between virtual and real nodes. 
another aspect of the problem:
how can we represent protein structure as sturcture function relationships
but pruning is a subquestion is how we can prune our represetatoin of proteins so we can accurately fish out funcitonal nodes
often times distal relationships are proxies of something that are physical-chemical in nature
in terms of pruning layers, individual residues should contribute to residue function more than the motif itself
so secondary structure motifs are not as important as the residues themselves in terms of pruning preferences
Pruining is fine, but it artificially inflates evaluation metrics, it's good but experiments should happen independently of pruinng before you start 
adding in pruning layers. Final model weights are done with pruning. Pruning helps reevaluate occupancy of model (to fill in all possible weights to keep
as much information about statistical biases) => then prune to keep the most relevant features, but the low and medium importance features are what come out
during the training procedure. We use pruning to optimize the model for production, but in exploratory phase, we don't want to prune since that minimizes
differences between worst performers and median performers. 

if you want to prune, do it, but run experiments without pruning first.
RPNs are only one solution to semantic segmentation, so look at other solutions  
can re-predict regions in labelled data is enough to run first test
