Initial run params:

optim: SGD, lr 0.01 - 0.1 cyclic LR 
num epochs 100

Metrics:
BCE (non anomaly inversion) from compute_confusion_matrix (so above % tp possible),

Changes for future runs: loss itself, 
    optimizer (this alone should be same run as current), just use adam,
    dimenet vs no dimenet
